# Hirst-Painting-Project

The Hirst Painting Project is a Python program that generates stunning Hirst-style paintings inspired by the works of the renowned artist Damien Hirst. This project combines image processing techniques and the Turtle graphics package to create visually captivating artwork.

# Color Extraction: 
The project starts by selecting the most used colors from a random image. It utilizes image processing algorithms to identify the dominant colors, which will later be used to recreate the Hirst-style painting.

# Color List: 
After extracting the dominant colors, the program compiles them into a list. This list serves as a reference for the Turtle graphics package to create the painting.

# Turtle Graphics: 
The Turtle package in Python is employed to draw the Hirst-style painting on a canvas. The Turtle graphics library allows for the creation of intricate and mesmerizing patterns, which perfectly suits the style of Hirst's paintings.

# Randomization: 
Each time the program is executed, a new random image is selected, ensuring that each Hirst painting generated is unique and one-of-a-kind.
